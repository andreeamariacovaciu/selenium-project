## Selenium Project

The purpose of this project is to collect data from web using Selenium and make predictions based on it.
The data are collected from https://www.bvb.ro/FinancialInstruments/Details/FinancialInstrumentsDetails.aspx?s=m and they represent the price for Medlife stock. Predictions are made using an ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) model.
